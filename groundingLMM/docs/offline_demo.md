## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the GLaMM Repository
First, you need to clone the GLaMM repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/groundingLMM.git
````

## 2. Download GLaMM Weights
To download the GLaMM model weights, you will need Git LFS. If you haven't installed Git LFS, you can do so by running:

```bash
git lfs install
```
Once Git LFS is installed, proceed to clone the GLaMM FullScope model:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI/GLaMM-FullScope
```

For more information on the GLaMM FullScope model, visit [this link](https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI/GLaMM-FullScope).


### 3. Run the Demo

Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned and run the demo using Python. Replace path_to_GLaMM_FullScope_model with the actual path to the downloaded GLaMM FullScope model:
```bash
python app.py --version "path/to/GLaMM_FullScope_model"

```

Once the demo is running, follow the on-screen instructions to open the demo dashboard in your web browser. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the GLaMM model.
